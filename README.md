# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Based on different factors presence of heart disease is detected in different people. The dataset has been obtained from UCI repository. The link is as follows https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/.

A thing to notice here is that the dataset present on kaggle is not in the correct form and therefore should be avoided.
The dataset contains following attributes:
age: The person's age in years

sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)

chest pain: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)

resting blood pressure: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

cholestrol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl

fasting blood sugar: The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)

max heart rate: The person's maximum heart rate achieved

exercise induced angina: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

ST Depression: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more here)

slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)

Major Vessels: The number of major vessels (0-3)

thallesemia: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)

target: Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)


After data cleaning,feature engineering and exploratory data analysis different classification algorithms were applied to the datset and different accuracies were obtained
